# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application built using TypeScript and Node.js. The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with these languages and technologies while implementing a basic calculator.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Percentage calculations
- Toggle sign functionality (positive/negative)
- Clear all (AC) functionality
- User-friendly interface built with React and styled-components
